OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT :
To comprehensively secure a PC if a recognizable Bluetooth device is
unavailable in its proximity.

We’re using Bluetooth command line tools to achieve the desired result.



HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
The application would need a PC or laptop to run which should be able to
provide Bluetooth services and the platform should have Bluetooth
Command Line Tools pre-installed in it to run all its functions.



CONTRIBUTION THE PROJECT WILL MAKE
Our project can be very beneficial in an office environment wherein the
people work in open spaces (cubicles) and if they leave their desk,
intruders can access their PC. With our project as soon as they leave their
cubicle, their PC will automatically get locked.
